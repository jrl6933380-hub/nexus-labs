// e2e/accessibility.spec.mjs
// Real automated accessibility + mobile coverage for task 10.
//
// LIVES OUTSIDE test/ ON PURPOSE: Node's built-in test runner
// auto-discovers every file under test/ regardless of its name or
// extension, which broke the existing 246-test node:test suite the
// first time this file was placed there (Playwright's test()/expect
// aren't node:test's — confirmed by actually running node --test
// after adding it, not assumed safe). e2e/ keeps this Playwright suite
// completely separate from node --test's discovery.
//
// WHY THIS ISN'T A node:test FILE AT ALL: it needs an actual rendering
// engine. Two standard approaches were tried directly in the dev
// sandbox this project's agents use for verification, and BOTH
// reproducibly crash there — confirmed by isolated testing, not
// assumed:
//   1. Puppeteer/headless Chromium — the sandbox lacks the OS-level
//      shared libraries a spawned Chromium process needs (libnss3,
//      libatk-bridge2.0-0, etc.); even after installing them via
//      apt-get, the launch still failed with no diagnosable output,
//      suggesting a deeper resource constraint on spawning a native
//      GUI-class process there.
//   2. jsdom — segfaults on `new JSDOM(...)` in that same sandbox,
//      even in complete isolation with no other code involved.
// GitHub Actions' own Ubuntu runners reliably support
// `playwright install --with-deps`, which is the standard, correct
// place to run real browser-based tests — see
// .github/workflows/accessibility.yml. This file is real, structurally
// correct Playwright + axe-core code, written using the standard,
// officially-maintained @axe-core/playwright integration — it has not
// been run end-to-end by the agent that wrote it, because the dev
// sandbox cannot run it; it needs to run once in CI (or by Justin
// locally) to be verified for real.
